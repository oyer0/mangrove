# Focused test coverage

On Linux, `make test` runs the host suite; on macOS, use `gmake test`.
It covers timekeeping, terminal, Reed, MGFS version admission, VMM, heap,
history, synchronization, storage, development-image guard, and password tests.

| Target | Production code exercised | Test boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-vmm` | User mapping/path allocation functions | Physical tables, mutexes and shootdowns are fixtures; no SMP integration. |
| `test-heap` | Allocation/free and local validation | Heap backing is host memory; growth is a fixture. |
| `test-history` | Shoot history/ring logic; VFS and MGFS merge/snapshot; MGFS write/truncate, spanning tombstones, record-ID/create lifecycle, and 2 MiB private replacement and creation staging | Separate state mocks and fault-injected block fixtures; not crash recovery. |
| `test-sync` | Scheduler handoff publication/selection, termination admission, process and session retirement, retained handle lookup, 2 MiB file-replacement and exclusive-create syscall copying and libc ABI, streamed VFS snapshot expectation and coherent node metadata, mutex wake/ownership, recursive block gate | Deterministic interleavings and pthread workers; scheduler parking, IRQs, process resources, user mappings, and VFS outcomes are fixtures. No guest scheduling claim. |
| `test-storage` | Block retirement, GPT backing cleanup, mutation admission; AHCI completion/recovery, xHCI teardown, BOT retry, cache/read-ahead and USB batching | Pthread/IRQ fixtures, simulated MMIO, timing, DMA, command and device failures. These are production-path host tests, not hardware integration or physical recovery verification. |
| `test-terminal` | UTF-8 decoder; terminal scroll/render/overlay/input positioning | In-memory framebuffer and fixture font/locks; not graphical QEMU. |
| `test-reed` | Reed buffer edits and production snapshot/load, conditional-save, exclusive-create, Save As, stale-generation conflict prompt, and saved-baseline paths | Native file calls and terminal events are controlled fixtures; no guest UI or filesystem integration. |
| `test-dev-tools` | Development-image update script guard | Disposable images and missing/busy/idle tool fixtures. |
| `test-password` | SHA-256, HMAC, PBKDF2 and authentication | Host compiler/entropy fixture; comparison with Python references. |

`test-launch` remains a compatibility alias for VMM, heap and history tests.
The oversized harness has been split into subsystem files. Temporary C programs
are extracted from production definitions; fixtures duplicate only the required
surrounding ABI. These tests do not establish whole-kernel integration or ABI
compatibility by themselves. Build and guest tests are still required.

The mgfs_device_identity_test.py fixture executes production block admission,
FAT32 mounted read/write and FAT-entry helpers, exFAT mounted I/O, dirty-flag
updates and sync, plus MGFS identity-bound paths. Pthread-backed waiters and
device callbacks inject removal, slot reuse, failed reads, partial writes,
multi-copy metadata failures, and flush failures. The fixture does not model
the full filesystem namespace, hardware DMA, or transaction recovery.
`fat_exfat_mount_identity_test.py` compiles the production FAT32 and exFAT
drivers into controlled mounted-media fixtures. It exercises repeated lookup,
empty-file identity, ordinary mutation generations, rename, slot reuse,
coherent snapshot bytes, cached size updates, ambiguous writes, and saved
device identity. VFS node registration and size publication, block callbacks,
and heap allocation are controlled dependencies. It does not prove full
guest concurrency or power-loss recovery.
The FAT32 fixture also executes the bounded full-directory walker and private
namespace ownership preflight against controlled FAT sectors and directory
clusters. It covers multi-cluster lookup and mutation, nested directories,
shared file/directory clusters, malformed chains and long-filename metadata,
read/allocation failure, and a byte-counted heap peak. Device callbacks and
VFS admission are controlled host dependencies; this does not test an actual
guest mount, out-of-band media changes, or safe-file publication.
Setting `FAT32_IMAGE` to a disposable FAT32 image also runs production mount,
later-cluster lookup, file read, and ownership validation against that image.
The image is opened read-only; the default host suite does not require image
formatting tools.
`vfs_node_registration_test.py` executes production registration and
retargeting to check a lookup node cannot be linked to a detached or removed
superblock. Metadata locking and device liveness are controlled fixtures.
The VFS admission fixture also executes the production mount-identity check
for a retired or reused slot; its root/node/path route checks inspect source
ordering rather than execute complete mount publication.

`mgfs_record_lifecycle_test.py` exercises production index growth/cluster deletion,
record allocation/release, directory append and create cleanup with injected
allocation, read, failed-write and partial-write failures. Metadata checksums,
directory lookup/publication in the create fixture, and VFS registration are
fixtures; separate append cases use the production append function. Its optional
source-root and `exhaustion`/`cleanup` arguments reproduce the committed baseline
regressions (legacy release frees the bitmap slot without removing its ID).

`mgfs_stage_cancel_test.py` compiles production MGFS staging, replacement,
and create-with-contents functions, including the locked VFS hook. The create
cases exercise fresh child data, copy-on-write directory append, same-block and separate-block
record publications, bitmap and table write failures, incomplete input,
parent cleanup, and recovery-pin handoff. Block I/O, heap allocation, VFS
authorization and pin ownership are controlled fixtures. A failed block write
can copy zero or half the submitted image into fixture media; this does not
model crash recovery, sector atomicity, or a running guest.

`vfs_create_contents_test.py` compiles production VFS exclusive-create
admission and return-node registration functions. Its MGFS hook, recovery
pin, block-device removal, and metadata lock are controlled fixtures; the
production MGFS hook and transaction are exercised by the MGFS fixture above.

`file_create_contents_syscall_test.py` compiles production process handle-slot
reservation, object preparation, and native create-syscall functions. It
checks invisible reservations, activation, cancellation, input-copy failures,
full-size 2 MiB input, and VFS error mapping. The replacement syscall fixture
also executes production snapshot copyout callbacks and admission, including
failure after a data chunk and failure at result-state copyout. User page
tables and VFS publication
are controlled fixtures; it does not model guest SMP or durable media.

For guest verification, use a disposable image (`STATE_DIR` outside `.mangrove`)
and QEMU `-snapshot`. Exercise `history` options, nested session saves, external
history replacement followed by `-n`, and completion/editing on a command that
wraps over several rows. Never use the user's persistent image for destructive
history or fault-injection fixtures.
